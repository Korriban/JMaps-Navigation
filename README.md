### JMaps
A small Java navigation app using the google maps api for your convenience.


#Build instructions:
Add the following libraries via maven:

#com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.0
#com.google.maps:google-maps-services:0.1.20
#commons-io:commons-io:2.5

Preferably use your own API Key. 

How the project came to life: I helped a friend not fail his Software Engineering course and it actually ended up being useful :D
